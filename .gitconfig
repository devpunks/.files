[color]

  # color.ui
  #  This variable determines the default value for variables such as color.diff and color.grep that
  #  control the use of color per command family. Its scope will expand as more commands learn
  #  configuration to set a default for the --color option. Set it to always if you want all output
  #  not intended for machine consumption to use color, to true or auto if you want such output to use
  #  color when written to the terminal, or to false or never if you prefer git commands not to use
  #  color unless enabled explicitly with some other configuration or the --color option.
  ui = always

  # color.pager
  #  A boolean to enable/disable colored output when the pager is in use (default is true).
  pager = true

  # color.diff
  #  Whether to use ANSI escape sequences to add color to patches. If this is set to always, git-
  #  diff(1), git-log(1), and git-show(1) will use color for all patches. If it is set to true or
  #  auto, those commands will only use color when output is to the terminal. Defaults to false.
  #  This does not affect git-format-patch(1) nor the git-diff-* plumbing commands. Can be overridden
  #  on the command line with the --color[=<when>] option.
  diff = always
  grep = always

  # color.status
  #  A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of git-status(1). May be set to always, false (or
  #  never) or auto (or true), in which case colors are used only when the output is to a terminal.
  #  Defaults to false.
  status = always

  # color.branch
  #  A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of git-branch(1).
  #  May be set to always, false (or never) or auto (or true),
  #  in which case colors are used only when the output is to a terminal.
  #
  # Defaults to false.
  branch = always
  decorate = always

  # color.showbranch
  #  A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of git-show-branch(1). May be set to always,
  #  false (or never) or auto (or true), in which case colors are used only when the output is to a
  #  terminal. Defaults to false.
  showbranch = always

  # color.interactive
  #   When set to always, always use colors for interactive prompts and displays
  #   (such as those used by "git-add --interactive"). When false (or never), never.
  #   When set to true or auto, use colors only when the output is to the terminal.
  #
  #   Defaults to false.
  interactive = always


# color.branch.<slot>
#  Use customized color for branch coloration.  <slot> is one of current (the current branch), local
#  (a local branch), remote (a remote-tracking branch in refs/remotes/), plain (other refs).

#  The value for these configuration variables is a list of colors (at most two) and attributes (at
#  most one), separated by spaces. The colors accepted are:
#    normal, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white;
#  the attributes are:
#    bold, dim, ul, blink and reverse.
#
#  The first color given is the foreground; the second is the background.
#  The position of the attribute, if any, doesn't matter.

#  func (function in hunk header), old (removed lines), new (added lines), commit (commit headers),

#     are changed but not added in the index), untracked (files which are not tracked by git), branch
